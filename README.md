## Preschool Assessment Project
**Supervisor:** Dr. Zhiling Shea  
**Team Members:** Qilin Zhou, Zhang Rui

### Overview
This project focuses on analyzing preschool assessments across various states in the USA. Using a data-driven approach, we aim to understand trends, variations, and impacts of different assessment strategies in early education.

### Data Sources
Our analysis is based on data from two primary sources:

1. **NIEER (National Institute For Early Education Research) State Preschool Yearbooks**
   - Comprehensive data on state-funded preschool programs.
   - Covers enrollment, funding, teacher qualifications, and quality standards.
   - [NIEER State Preschool Yearbooks](https://nieer.org/state-preschool-yearbooks)

2. **United States Census Bureau 2020 Shapefile of U.S. States**
   - Detailed geographic data for all U.S. states, crucial for geospatial analysis.
   - [Census Bureau TIGER/Line Shapefiles](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html)

### Methodology
Integrating preschool assessment data from the NIEER yearbooks with geospatial data from the Census Bureau to perform comprehensive analysis.

### Objectives
- Evaluate and compare preschool assessment strategies across states.
- Understand the impact of these strategies on early childhood education outcomes.
- Provide data-driven insights for policymakers and educational stakeholders.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Data Processing and Analysis:** Python, Pandas, NumPy
- **Geospatial Analysis:** GeoPandas, ArcGIS
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
