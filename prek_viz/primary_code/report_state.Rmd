## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
data <- read.csv("preschool_assessment.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
n_distinct(data$RequiredAssessmentforpreK)
```

```{r}
unique(data$RequiredAssessmentforpreK)
```

```{r}
